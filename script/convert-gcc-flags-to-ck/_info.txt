Note: build_flags_not_finished_and_need_gcc_src.py is not finished:
  -fno-no flags - not right ...

However, you can use CK:
 ck extract_opts compiler

Also, note that for our papers until 2015, 
old script was used (developed by Yuriy Kashnikov),
hence number of boolean and parametric optimizations
can differ.

New script:
* GCC 4.9.2:
  boolean=190
  parametric=167
