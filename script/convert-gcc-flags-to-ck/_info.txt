Note: build_flags_not_finished_and_need_gcc_src.py is not finished:
  -fno-no flags - not right ...

However, you can use CK:
 ck extract_opts compiler

Also, note that for our papers until 2015, 
old script was used (developed by Yuriy Kashnikov),
hence number of boolean and parametric optimizations
can differ.

New script:
* GCC 4.9.2:
  boolean=190
  parametric=167

* GCC 5.2.0:
  boolean+215
  parametric=181

What we can note, is that total number of optimizations
is getting to a saturation (we are not inventing many
new and effective optimizations), but the focus
is now on finer-grain parameterization of internal optimizations.

Motivates our work on fine-grain autotuning via GCC
plugin based interface which we added with colleagues 
to GCC 4.6 (based on Interactive Compilation Interface).
